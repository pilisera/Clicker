Clicker
=============

Repeatedly simulate mouse clicks. 

Input is given to System.in as lines of 3 numbers separated by spaces. The first two are the x and y coordinates of the mouse press, the third is the number of times it will be pressed. Any extra information on a line after that is ignored.

Eg: passing
    100 100 5
    100 200 3
into the program will click 5 times at (100, 100) then 3 times at (100, 200).

Future work includes a graphical way to input coordinates, and a command-line/graphical way to alter the delay between clicks.
